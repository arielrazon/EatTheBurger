# Eat the Burger
Proof-of-Concept with Handlebars (template engine) and MongoDB on Heroku

## What is “Eat the Burger” ?

Eat the Burger is a simple proof-of-concept page based on Handlebars (a templating engine) and MongoDB, for users to save burgers and random list of items on a page. It was something I made to test out my knowledge of mongoDB and hosting a simple Mongo app on Heroku. 

## Functionality/Usage

1. Upon loading, the user will see a list of "devoured" burgers. This is stored on the database and the same view is shared by all users who visit the app-page.
2. The user can subsequently add and "Devour" different burgers, and the status of those items will be saved in the database.
